# Conversly Design System Inconsistencies

## Typography Issues

### Hierarchy Problems
- No clear primary/secondary/tertiary text relationships established
- Main headline "Practice conversations. Build confidence." has inconsistent emphasis treatment
- Body text lacks proper size scaling and weight differentiation
- Loading state text doesn't follow established hierarchy patterns
- Review section mixing multiple text weights without systematic approach

### Font Treatment Inconsistencies
- Inconsistent line-heights across different sections
- Mixed text alignment (center vs left) without systematic reasoning
- No clear font-size scale or modular typography system
- Heading styles vary between sections without design logic

## Color System Failures

### Primary Color Usage
- Orange accent color (#FF6B47 or similar) used inconsistently
- CTA buttons use orange but no other interactive elements follow this pattern
- No secondary or tertiary color definitions visible
- Missing color hierarchy for different interaction states

### State Colors Missing
- No defined colors for success, warning, error, or info states
- Loading states use generic colors instead of branded palette
- No hover, active, or focus state color definitions
- Review section star ratings don't align with brand color system

### Background Color Inconsistencies
- Multiple shades of beige/cream without systematic approach
- Card backgrounds vs page background lack proper contrast ratios
- No defined color tokens for surfaces, backgrounds, and containers

## Spacing System Problems

### Margin and Padding Chaos
- Inconsistent spacing between major sections
- Card padding varies between loading states and final review
- No systematic spacing scale (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px grid system)
- Vertical rhythm broken between text elements

### Layout Grid Issues
- No consistent grid system for element alignment
- Floating elements without proper spatial relationships
- Inconsistent gutters and margins throughout the flow
- Container widths vary without responsive breakpoint logic

## Component Library Failures

### Button Inconsistencies
- "Start Conversation" vs "Start New Conversation" buttons have different treatments
- No standardized button sizes (small, medium, large)
- Missing button states (disabled, loading, success)
- Inconsistent border-radius values across button elements

### Card Component Problems
- Main conversation card has different styling treatment across states
- Inconsistent card shadows and elevation hierarchy
- Border treatments vary between different card instances
- No systematic approach to card padding and content spacing

### Form Element Issues
- No visible form inputs to assess consistency
- Missing standardized input states and validation styling
- No systematic approach to form layout and spacing

## Interactive Element Inconsistencies

### Loading States
- Different loading spinner treatments across connection phases
- Inconsistent messaging hierarchy during loading
- No standardized loading component with consistent styling
- Progress indicators lack systematic visual treatment

### Navigation Elements
- Top navigation uses different styling than main interface
- Inconsistent active/inactive state treatments
- Missing systematic approach to navigation hierarchy
- No clear navigation component pattern established

## Iconography and Visual Elements

### Icon System Missing
- No consistent icon style or weight
- Missing iconography for different states and actions
- No systematic approach to icon sizing and positioning
- Visual elements lack cohesive style treatment

### Visual Feedback Elements
- Star rating system doesn't match overall design language
- Progress indicators use different visual styles
- Status indicators lack systematic color and style treatment
- No consistent approach to visual hierarchy indicators

## Responsive Design System Issues

### Breakpoint Inconsistencies
- No clear responsive breakpoint system visible
- Layout appears fixed-width without adaptive behavior
- Missing systematic approach to mobile-first design
- Component scaling lacks responsive design tokens

### Mobile Optimization Missing
- No evidence of mobile-specific component variations
- Touch target sizes not optimized for mobile interaction
- Typography scaling for smaller screens not addressed
- Layout stacking order not systematically planned

## Accessibility Design System Gaps

### Focus State System
- No visible focus indicator system for keyboard navigation
- Missing systematic approach to accessible color contrasts
- No defined focus ring styles or interactive element highlighting
- Tab order and focus flow not systematically designed

### Color Contrast Issues
- Insufficient contrast ratios between text and background colors
- No systematic approach to accessible color combinations
- Missing high-contrast mode considerations
- Color-only information without alternative indicators

## Design Token Deficiencies

### Missing Token Categories
- No defined spacing tokens (margins, padding, gaps)
- Missing typography tokens (font-sizes, line-heights, font-weights)
- No color tokens with semantic naming conventions
- Missing elevation/shadow token system
- No border-radius token standardization
- Missing animation/transition duration tokens

### Systematic Implementation Issues
- No evidence of design token usage across components
- Inconsistent implementation of visual properties
- Missing design system documentation or standards
- No systematic approach to design system maintenance and updates
